FileVault:

FileVault is an RFID-based file storage system with User access accounts and will create new ones with new RFIDS. Since many
users do not have the hardware for RFID usability, there is an included RFID Simulator. Simply type in any string (Not too long) 
into the simulator and create a new account, which will be saved when you exit the program. (Open this program in an IDE)\
